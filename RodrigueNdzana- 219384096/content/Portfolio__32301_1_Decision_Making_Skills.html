 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Situation:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">During my work integrated learning program at a technology firm, I encountered a crucial decision-making scenario that required a thoughtful and strategic approach. The project involved developing a new software application aimed at enhancing data security measures for all public transport. As a member of the development team, I was tasked with making critical decisions regarding the application's architecture and security features. How the we going to make the user data private and only be access to them.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Task:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The main task was to design a robust and secure smart access software application to safeguard the client's sensitive data. The client in this cases are public transport. This entailed assessing different architectural designs, encryption methods, and security protocols. The decision-making process involved selecting the most appropriate technological solutions to ensure maximum data protection while also considering the application's scalability and user-friendliness.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Action:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">I began by collecting information necessary to achieve these goals. The decision-making process was intricate as it had to cater to two user types: public transport and end-user transport.To address the challenge, I embarked on a thorough process of gathering information. This involved conducting in-depth research on various security architectures and encryption techniques. I studied industry best practices, consulted with senior developers, and explored case studies to understand different approaches on how it can be coorparate in the system and their implications on data security and software performance.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">After gathering information, I meticulously assessed and evaluated different architectural designs and encryption methods. I weighed the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of security, scalability, and user accessibility. Moreover, I considered the practicality of implementation and the compatibility of these solutions with the existing infrastructure.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Decision-Making and Implementation: Taking into account the information gathered and evaluations made, I participated in collaborative discussions with the team and supervisors. Through these discussions, we deliberated on the most effective and balanced approach. We chose an architecture that prioritized end-to-end encryption, multi-layered security protocols, and a user-friendly interface, ensuring the application was both highly secure and easy to use. To enhanced better form of security we decided that the user must first register and then login to access our sytem. For security purpose I decided I should encode their password. This mean that even the administrator wont have access to view user's password.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Result:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The decision to implement a password encoded, end-to-end encrypted architecture significantly bolstered the application's security measures. The software provided enhanced data protection for the user's sensitive information while maintaining a user-friendly experience. The chosen approach ensured the application's scalability and compatibility with the existing systems.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">This decision-making experience during my work integrated learning program demonstrated the importance of a comprehensive and meticulous approach to decision-making. By gathering diverse perspectives, conducting in-depth research, and carefully evaluating options, I contributed to selecting an optimal solution that balanced security, usability, and scalability. The process reinforced the significance of informed decision-making in software development and highlighted the necessity of balancing multiple factors to arrive at a strategic and effective choice.</p>
