 <p><strong>Situation:&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p>Throughout my work-integrated learning experience at CPUT, I participated in the Smart Access team. The primary objective of our team was to design and develop the Smart Access App, aimed at managing and providing accessible information about available vehicles for clients. To ensure the success of this initiative, we divided into pairs, with specific roles: a developer responsible for creating the interface and a network specialist tasked with connecting to the API to retrieve information about the available vehicles. As a member of the developer team, our focus was on crafting the front-end design using a programming language of our preference.</p> 
 <p><strong>Task:</strong></p> 
 <p>As part of the developer team, my responsibility was to create the front-end of the application, designing the prototype to ensure it was accessible for mobile users. At the same time, I worked closely with the Network team to devise a new protocol aimed at resolving issues and enhancing the overall user experience.</p> 
 <p><strong>Action:</strong></p> 
 <p>I organized regular team meetings to generate ideas and update everyone on our progress. Actively engaging in discussions, I shared insights derived from research findings. Working closely with both the network and developer teams, I aimed to enhance communication by consolidating everyone's input into a more unified approach. Additionally, I willingly offered support to colleagues experiencing challenges in their tasks, promoting a smoother workflow and a sense of motivation among team members. Creating a GitHub repository, I invited all my teammates to collaborate on the project, dedicating time to assist those who were unfamiliar with the platform. GitHub served as a useful tool for facilitating project collaboration, allowing us to view and modify each other's work, promoting a more collaborative and efficient work environment.</p> 
 <p><strong>Result:</strong></p> 
 <p>Certain elements of the project were successfully implemented. As the developer team, we managed to code the front end, which includes the registration and login pages. The default home page displays basic information about the website. We've enabled user authentication to access other pages on the website. To view these pages, users are required to first register and then log in. This process assists in identifying our clients and ensures the protection of personal data from any potential breaches.</p>
