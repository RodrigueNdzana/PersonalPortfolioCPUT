 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://github.com/RodrigueNdzana/capstoneProjectFinal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School Attendance System Gitbub repo</a></strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Situation:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">In my third year at university, I was a member of a diverse team tasked with a semester-long project in the Application Development Practice 3 course. Our project focused on creating an inventive solution for a sustainable school attendance system tailored for CPUT (Cape Peninsula University of Technology). This system aimed to effectively monitor the presence or absence of students in specific classes. As a team member, my responsibilities extended to both technical duties and ensuring effective communication among my team, the project supervisor, and our client, CPUT.</p> 
 <p><strong>Task: </strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Our objective involved developing a complete application that detailed the technical components of our suggested school attendance system while maintaining clear and efficient communication within the team. This meant ensuring all team members comprehended the project's scope. The task demanded the synthesis of intricate technical details into an understandable format. My responsibility was to collaborate with team members from diverse backgrounds, considering my origins from Cameroon, and effectively convey our project's advancements and difficulties. Being the sole individual responsible for coding the system and having a better grasp of its technical intricacies, I played a crucial role in ensuring that everyone comprehended the project's technical aspects.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Action:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to foster effective communication within our team, I took the lead in organizing routine meetings to update our supervisor on our progress and to hold discussions with our client, ensuring that our work remained within the specified scope. I allocated tasks based on each team member's strengths and maintained an open channel for communication through platforms like WhatsApp and email. Encouraging an open and non-judgmental environment to give an opportunities to other member to voice their opinions, I actively listened to my team members, promoting the expression of their ideas and concerns. Whenever conflicts or misunderstandings emerged, which were not uncommon in our team dynamic, I facilitated discussions to navigate through disagreements and ensure that every team member felt acknowledged and valued.</p> 
 <p>Apart from talking within our team, I took the initiative to engage with our supervisor. I created short and clear presentations, using pictures and data to explain the technical parts of our project. I asked for opinions from our team and clients outside the group to make our way of communicating better.</p> 
 <p>I also saw the value of writing stuff down. I made reports and papers, making sure they were easy to understand and stuck to what we wanted to do. I shared reports on our progress with the team and kept everyone informed about any changes or problems, making sure everyone knew what was going on. This helped us work together openly and smartly.</p> 
 <p><br></p> 
 <p><strong>Result:&nbsp;</strong></p> 
 <p>Our team's hard work paid off, resulting in the successful development of an innovative School Attendance System. By making sure we communicated well within the team, we boosted how we worked together and combined the strengths of team members from different areas, leading to a strong and unified project. Our talks with the supervisor and client went down well, showing how well we got our messages across.</p> 
 <p>What's more, our constant communication and teamwork improved the quality of our project documents, making them better and easier to understand. Effective communication not only helped our project succeed but also made our working environment positive and inclusive, where everyone felt important.</p> 
 <p>In the end, my involvement in this university project showed how good I am at communicating. From running great team talks to explaining difficult technical stuff to different groups of people, my ability to talk clearly and well played a big part in our project's success. This experience helped me see how important good communication is for a project and for a team to work together.</p>
