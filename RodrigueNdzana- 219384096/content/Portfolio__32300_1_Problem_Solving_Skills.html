 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="https://revolutionarybot.netlify.app/project/login.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Educational Chatbot live website</a></strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Situation:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">In my third year at university, I was part of a team working on a project to create an educational chatbot. Our goal was to develop an educational chatbot capable of providing educational support to CPUT students by offering explanations on various academic topics and assisting in answering academic queries. As the lead programmer, I encountered a significant problem while coding the registration system of chatbot. The issue involved the chatbot's inability store the user value after registration is done so that the could use the same detail to login, hindering its effectiveness in delivering educational content.Identifying the problem, I realized the chatbot's responses were not contextually accurate, often providing generic or irrelevant information for complex academic queries.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Task:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The task was to design and implement an educational chatbot equipped with natural language processing capabilities to interpret and respond to user inquiries effectively. My responsibility was to code the register system of the the chatbot's&nbsp; also underlying algorithms and structure, ensuring its ability to understand a diverse range of academic questions and deliver appropriate and accurate responses.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Actions:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">To resolve the issue, I began researching and exploring advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms suitable for improving the chatbot's comprehension and response accuracy. None of that works for me. However during my research I came across <a href="https://app.wotnot.io/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wotnot</a> which provide me with a template I can create the bot. from</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">I took several strategic steps to enhance the chatbot's capabilities. I incorporated sentiment analysis algorithms using JavaScript library to assess the sentiment of user queries, such as allowing the user to log in&nbsp; after register.&nbsp; Intent recognition models were integrated to identify the user's purpose within each query. This involved training the chatbot to classify inquiries based on their intent, enabling it to understand the specific objective of the user's question through various option the user can select from.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">Simultaneously, I expanded the chatbot's knowledge base by integrating it with a more extensive database of academic resources and textbooks. This was complemented by a feature that tracked and learned from previous successful interactions, allowing the chatbot to refine its responses over time.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">We conducted rigorous testing and gathered feedback from the team and potential users. Based on the collected data and insights, I fine-tuned the algorithms, continuously iterating and improving the chatbot's performance.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Result:</strong></p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The implemented enhancements significantly improved the chatbot's performance. It became more adept at understanding complex academic inquiries and provided more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Users found the chatbot's explanations to be more insightful and helpful, contributing positively to their educational queries.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">The educational chatbot received commendable feedback from users and academic advisors, acknowledging its value in providing educational support. The problem-solving approach not only rectified the immediate technical challenge but also contributed to the overall improvement and effectiveness of the chatbot.</p> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;">This experience exemplified the practical application of problem-solving skills in a real-world setting. Implementing advanced Javascript programming and&nbsp; enhanced the chatbot's abilities, demonstrating the application of theoretical knowledge in practical programming. The iterative development process and collaboration with the team and users were instrumental in refining the chatbot's performance and ensuring its effectiveness in delivering educational support. This problem-solving experience reinforced the importance of adaptability, continuous improvement, and user feedback in coding.</p>
